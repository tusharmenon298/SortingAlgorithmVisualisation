# *Java Programming Project*
## *Sorting Algorithm Visualisation*
<br>
<br>
This project was created for my college course on Java Programming
The purpose of this project was to help visualize how basic sorting algorithms work.
Its always easier to understand how an algorithm's operation works when you can visualize it.
And after seeing lot of youtube videos which do this, I tried to do the same
Currently, the project only has 4 sorting algorithms being used here-<br>
<ul>
<li> Selection Sort </li>
<li> Bubble Sort </li>
<li> Quick Sort </li>
<li> Merge Sort </li>
</ul>
<br>

##### *I'll add more sorts in future versions*

This is how the graphics look like

###### This is the first time I added my own project on github
